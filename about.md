Hi, and thanks for stopping by.

My name is Pierre, I'm a full stack developer with some technical leadership experience. I like building pragmatic engineering teams, efficient systems and elegant solutions.

I've previously attented law school, because I was interested in intellectual property and software patents. Eventually, software itself turned out to be more thrilling. I am now helping startups grow with proper infrastructure, tooling and processes.

I work out of Paris, France.

#### Why this site ?

This site is a collection of notes and thoughts. I've been meaning to blog for a while, because I have greatly benefited from others sharing technical tips that have sharpened my skills, and pieces that have built up my critical thinking.
