Hi, and thanks for stopping by.

My name is Pierre. I like building pragmatic engineering teams, efficient systems and elegant solutions. I am currently working with [SGH Capital](http://www.sghcapital.com/), out of Paris, France.

#### Why this site ?

This site is a collection of notes and thoughts. I've been meaning to blog for a while, because I have greatly benefited from others sharing technical tips that have sharpened my skills, and pieces that have built up my critical thinking.

I also share interesting links and quotes via [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@lavaux "Pierre Lavaux on Pocket") and [Refind](https://refind.com/prlvx "Pierre Lavaux on Refind").

#### Contact

Ping me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prlvx "Pierre Lavaux on Twitter"). Stalk me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierrelavaux "Pierre Lavaux on LinkedIn") or [GitHub](https://github.com/PierreLvx "Pierre Lavaux on GitHub").

If you wish to email me, it's my first name at this domain. To contact me securely, you can get my PGP key from [Keybase](https://keybase.io/pierrelavaux/pgp_keys.asc).

Found a mistake or a typo ? Do let me know, or [raise an issue](https://github.com/PierreLvx/lavaux.lv/issues). Thanks!

This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) + [Amplify](https://github.com/PierreLvx/lavaux.lv).
