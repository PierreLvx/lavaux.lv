Hi, and thanks for stopping by.

My name is Pierre. I like building pragmatic engineering teams, efficient systems and elegant solutions.

I am currently investing with [SGH Capital](http://www.sghcapital.com/), an early-stage venture capital firm.

Most of the investments I led are listed on [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/pierre-lavaux "Pierre Lavaux on Crunchbase") and [AngelList](https://angel.co/u/pierrelavaux "Pierre Lavaux on AngelList")

#### Why this site ?

This site is a collection of notes and thoughts. I've been meaning to blog for a while, because I have greatly benefited from others sharing technical tips that have sharpened my skills, and pieces that have built up my critical thinking.

I also share interesting links and quotes via [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@lavaux "Pierre Lavaux on Pocket").

If you wish to email me, it's my first name at this domain. To contact me securely, you can get my PGP key from [Keybase](https://keybase.io/pierrelavaux/pgp_keys.asc).
