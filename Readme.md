# Amplify for Jekyll

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PierreLvx/lavaux.lv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/PierreLvx/lavaux.lv)

This is my personal blog, based on [Amplify](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify).

Notable changes from the original theme include :

- Larger layout on tablet and desktop ;
- Refined typography ;
- Cleaner code blocks ;
- Support for AMP Analytics ([merged upstream](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify/pull/20)).

I am open sourcing it so that you can tweak my fork too. The codebase is very small and delete key friendly.
