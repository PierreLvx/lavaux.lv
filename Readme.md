[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e1eab642-9398-476a-9297-9ebc172f13db/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/modest-agnesi-a72970/deploys)

This is my personal blog, based on [Amplify](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify).

Notable changes from the original theme include :

- Larger layout on tablet and desktop ;
- Refined typography ;
- Cleaner code blocks ;
- Support for AMP Analytics ([merged upstream](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify/pull/20)).

I am open sourcing it so that you can tweak my fork too.
