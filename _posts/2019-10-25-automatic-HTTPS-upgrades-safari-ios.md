title: Enabling Automatic HTTPS Upgrades on Safari (iOS)

I have been using the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/) as my main browser for almost two months now. One of its privacy-enhancing features is automatic HTTPS upgrades, which I feel should be a default for all browsers.

It turns out that if you dig deep enough in the settings of Safari on iOS 13.x, you can enforce HTTPS upgrades too. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to your device **Settings** and then **Safari**
2. Scroll down to **Advanced**
3. Tap **Experimental Features**
4. In the list, now enable **Automatic HTTPS Upgrade**

Done!
